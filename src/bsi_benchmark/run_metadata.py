Run-level metadata for a ComparisonReport, so a report can stand on its
own as evidence: which exact code produced it, when, and with what known
methodological limitations -- rather than a bare score table with no
provenance.

This does NOT make BSI scores a validated psychometric instrument. It
makes the *report* an honest, checkable record of what was run.
